# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera final project

##Set up
You will need to instal the dplyr package to R. You can do this by calling install.packages("dplyr") in R console.

call source("run_analysis.R") to run the script. The script should generate the variable 
tidyDataSet, which is a data frame containing the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. MAKE SURE to have the UCI folder dataset in the same directory as run_analysis.R otherwise an error will appear.
